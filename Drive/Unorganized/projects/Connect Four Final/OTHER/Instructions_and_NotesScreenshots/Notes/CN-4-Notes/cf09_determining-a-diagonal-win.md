Hopefully, you've got the gist of this, now. Create an inspector just for the
diagonals. Do the same kind of column splicing. This time, check the diagonals
in both directions inside the slice. Return the value if you find four entries.

Hook it up into the `Game` the same way that you did `checkForTie`,
`checkForColumnWin`, and `checkForRowWin`.
