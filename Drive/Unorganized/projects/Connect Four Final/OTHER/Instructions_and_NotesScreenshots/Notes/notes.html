<li><p>CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.</p></li>
<li>Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.</li>
<li>However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables.</li>
<li><p>For example, a grid container’s child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The grid CSS property is a shorthand property ( shorthand properties are common properties acting on the same theme.— For instance, the CSS background property is a shorthand property that’s able to define the values of background-color, background-image, background-repeat, and background-position. Similarly, the most common font-related properties can be defined using the shorthand font, and the different margins around a box can be defined using the margin shorthand.) that sets all of the explicit and implicit grid properties in a single declaration.</p></li>
