<p>[Alt Text]:<a href="https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-JavaScript/oop/oop-connect-four-final-product.gif" class="uri">https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-JavaScript/oop/oop-connect-four-final-product.gif</a></p>
<p>Please fork and clone the repository found at https://github.com/appacademy-starters/oop-connect-four.</p>
<p><strong>In that repository, you will find the following files:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>index.html: The HTML file that you’ll modify to structure your UI</li>
<li>site.css: The CSS file that you’ll modify to style your UI</li>
<li>connect-four.js: The JavaScript file you’ll modify to add behavior to your game</li>
<li>images/: A directory that contains images for the application.</li>
<li>README. md: A “read me” file that contains information about the project. Development with a Web server</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be the first time you use a local Web server to do your development. It’s going to be nearly identical to just opening your file from the file system, but</p>
<p><strong>you’ll be using a URL with the HTTP protocol rather than the file protocol. You’ll be using a simple HTTP server packaged with all Python 3 distributions. (You did install Python3 back at the end of week 1, right?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>After you clone your forked repository, open Visual Studio Code by typing code . in the repository directory. Then, type python3 -m http.server.</strong></p>
<p>(For those of you on Windows, if this is the first time you’re running the built-in HTTP server, you may seem some other terminals popping up and then closing, then a “Windows Defender Firewall” block message. Please check both “Private networks…” and “Public networks…” boxes before clicking the “Allow access” button.)</p>
<p>If everything is ok with your Python installation, you will see a message similar to</p>
<p>Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) … Note that port number, open a new tab or window in your browser, and type in http://localhost:«port number» into your browser’s address bar. You should see the UI!</p>
<p>When you need to stop the HTTP server, click back on the terminal window and type the key combination Control+C. That works on both Windows and macOS. That will stop the HTTP server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules of Connect Four</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first player drops a checker into a slot. The checker falls to the lowest open position in the column. If all six positions are full, the player cannot play in that column.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A player wins when they have four in a row anywhere in the board, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. (“Pretty sneaky, sis.”)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The game is a tie if the entire board fills and no one has four in a row.</p>
