<p>When it comes to pair programming, every team has their own process. Let’s explore App Academy’s specific approach to pairing up!</p>
<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>the App Academy path to pair programming success,</li>
<li>a quick routine for improving your pairing outcomes,</li>
<li>and modifications you can make for specific situations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-this-way">Why this way?</h2>
<p>It might feel unnecessary to have strict rules about working together. After all, you’ve been working with other people your whole life, right? Get ready - software engineering will be different!</p>
<p>Working as a programmer means being faced with frequent distractions. Strict rules help prevent those distractions so you can focus on what matters most. Additionally: when problems arise (as they inevitably will), people tend to fall back on old habits to cope with the stress. A rigid approach should provide us with at-the-ready coping strategies we can fall back on. When your team shares the same strategies, it makes it even easier to support each other through challenges!</p>
<p>Ultimately, we’re creating a shared language between teammates. When you move into your new career, you’ll have to adjust to the collaborative process of your new team. Think of this as an opportunity to build a foundation for that transition.</p>
<h2 id="the-rules">The rules</h2>
<p>Let’s lay out the steps to a successful pair programming session. This process will be the same whether you’re working together in-person or remotely.</p>
<h3 id="partner-up">Partner up</h3>
<p>You can’t pair program without a pair of programmers! Your first step should be partnering up with another student. While it might be more comfortable to have the same partner each time, try challenging yourself to select a new partner for every session. This will broaden your perspective and let you share your unique approaches to software with each other.</p>
<h3 id="check-in">Check-in</h3>
<p>Before beginning, it’s a good idea to check in with each other. Take a quick “lay of the land”: what will you be pairing on? How long do you expect this session to last? Do you need to plan breaks for lunch or does one of you have obligations that will cut the session short? Get these details scheduled with each other ahead of time to reduce surprises &amp; distractions later on.</p>
<p>This is a great time to assign roles as well. We encourage you to stick with the <em>Driver</em> and <em>Navigator</em> roles discussed previously. Over time, we’ve found that students who are more comfortable with the project being worked on prefer to act as Navigator first. This lets them establish the direction for the session and helps support the Driver. Of course, discuss this together before making a decision: your partner may have a different opinion!</p>
<h3 id="get-coding">Get coding!</h3>
<p>Once you’ve chosen initial roles, it’s time to dive in! Remember that you &amp; your partner should be working in a single editor, not two different ones. If you’re together in-person, this means one keyboard, one monitor, and two chairs. If you’re working remotely, this means one person is sharing their editor and the other is watching &amp; talking only.</p>
<p>To start, let the initial driver set up the development environment and set a timer for 15 minutes. The navigator should start mapping out the course of the project, letting the driver type out code and watching out for errors. Both driver &amp; navigator should be in <em>constant</em> communication: ask each other lots of questions and double-check each other’s ideas as you go! It’s okay to use your time together to search for documentation or help online as well.</p>
<p>If a question comes up that requires a lot of discussion or further research, pause your timer and talk it out. As you pair program more, you’ll find that these extended discussions become less frequent. It’s not that you’re talking less, but that you’re comfortable enough with the process to continue coding while working through bigger problems.</p>
<h3 id="hand-off">Hand off</h3>
<p>We follow a 15 minute rule at App Academy. This means you should change roles after every 15 minutes of progress - no exceptions! Frequent role reversal ensures you’re both getting equal exposure to the whole workflow, and it forces you to stay engaged and communicate through the transition.</p>
<p>When the timer is up, the driver should pass control to the navigator and begin navigating themselves. This will feel awkward at first, but remember that you’re building a new skill here: context switching while maintaining communication is <strong>crucial</strong> for being an effective developer.</p>
<p>Stick to the timer as closely as possible. It can be tempting to finish your current line of code/task before handing off, but that “last piece” might drag on for another 15 minutes by itself! If you’re communicating effectively, you should be able to the hand off mid-sentence and have your pair pick up right where you left off.</p>
<h3 id="follow-up">Follow-up</h3>
<p>It has been a long, productive day. How should you wrap up your programming session? Take a little time to reflect! Before officially ending your session, take a couple minutes to recap. Discuss what you accomplished. Did you meet your goals? Take a moment to celebrate! Are there tasks left incomplete? Make a few notes so you can pick these up with someone else next time.</p>
<p>The follow-up, like the check-in, helps commit your progress to memory. It’s also the perfect time to answer any lingering questions and provide/receive feedback on how the session went. Don’t skip this step because it feels superfluous; it’s just as important as the code you’ve written together!</p>
<h2 id="modifying-the-routine">Modifying the routine</h2>
<p>As you pair up more often, you’ll encounter days where the routine just isn’t working. Maybe your partner’s having a bad day - or maybe you’re having a bad day yourself! Maybe the day’s material hasn’t “clicked” for you yet, and you feel like your partner is speaking a totally different language. Yikes!</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that this is <strong>totally normal</strong>. We provide a strict pair programming routine to keep you on track, but we can’t plan for everything! Here are some things you can do to keep the routine fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step back &amp; discuss:</strong> If you’re feeling stuck, or having trouble keeping up with your partner, pause your timer and step away from the keyboard. This is a good signal that you need to discuss progress so far and make a plan for moving forward. You should always feel comfortable doing this if you’re unsure of something. Don’t worry about slowing your partner down; the goal of pair programming is that you both progress <strong>together</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on the process during your follow-up:</strong> Understanding and mastering the pair programming process is as much a part of our program as JavaScript and data structures. If you’re struggling with this process, discuss it! During your follow-up, take a moment to ask each other how you felt your communication went. You should discuss how you’re working to improve your own performance as both a driver &amp; navigator. By focusing on the process, you’re taking some of the awkwardness out of the relationship, and helping each other feel more comfortable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remember to reflect regularly:</strong> You may not do it daily, but it is important to reflect on your pair programming experiences at regular intervals throughout your course. At least once every few weeks, schedule some time to chat with a partner about how pair programming is working for you. Share your personal experiences and suggest a few things you’d like to do for yourself to improve the process. If you’ve paired with your partner before, this may also be an appropriate time to offer compliments and kind criticism.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>We know what pair programming <em>is</em>, and now we know <em>how</em> to do it! Practice following the App Academy process in your own pairing, and don’t forget to discuss your experiences as often as you can. You can’t be <strong>too</strong> good at pair programming; you’ll be pairing up for the rest of your new career.</p>
<p>You should now be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe each step of App Academy’s pair programming process,</li>
<li>explain why the process is important,</li>
<li>and suggest some ways to modify/improve the process as necessary.</li>
</ul>
