<p>Below is a complete list of the terminal learning objectives for this lesson. When you complete this lesson, you should be able to perform each of the following objectives. These objectives capture how you may be evaluated on the assessment for this lesson.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called “First Class Objects” in JavaScript.</li>
<li>Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple <code>console.log</code>s, predict what will be printed</li>
<li>Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater.</li>
<li>Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of <code>Array#map</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of <code>Array#filter</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of <code>Array#every</code>.</li>
