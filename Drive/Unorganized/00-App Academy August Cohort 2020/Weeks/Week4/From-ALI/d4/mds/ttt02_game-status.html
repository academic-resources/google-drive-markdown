<h1 id="requirement-3-determining-game-status">Requirement 3: Determining Game Status</h1>
<p>In this requirement, you will now determine if a game is won or in a tie state. To do this, you will need to check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a player has any three in a row, then that player wins.</li>
<li>If a player has any three in a column, then that player wins.</li>
<li>If a player has either of the diagonals, then that player wins.</li>
<li>If there is no win <em>and</em> all squares have a player symbol in there, then the game is a tie.</li>
<li>When the game begins, the header at the top should have no text in it.</li>
<li>When a player wins the game, then the following happens:
<ul>
<li>The header at the top should read “Winner: X” or “Winner: Y” depending on which player won.</li>
<li>Empty squares in the grid no longer react to clicks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When the game goes into a tied state, the header at the top should read “Winner: None”.</li>
</ul>
<p>During development, you can just refresh the browser to clear the board.</p>
