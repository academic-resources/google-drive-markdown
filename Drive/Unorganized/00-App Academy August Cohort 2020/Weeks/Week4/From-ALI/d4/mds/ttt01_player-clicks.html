<h1 id="requirement-2-tracking-grid-clicks">Requirement 2: Tracking Grid Clicks</h1>
<p>In this requirement, you will now track the clicks of the players and fill the grid with the appropriate symbols.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the “X” player, use the image found at https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/player-x.svg.</li>
<li>For the “O” player, use the image found at https://assets.aaonline.io/Module-DOM-API/formative-project-tic-tac-toe/player-o.svg.</li>
<li>When the player clicks an empty square, then it is filled with that player’s symbol.</li>
<li>When the player clicks a square that already contains a symbol, the game does nothing.</li>
<li>The first click results in an “X”. After that, the symbols “O” and “X” alternate with each click per the rules of tic-tac-toe.</li>
</ul>
<p>During development, you can just refresh the browser to clear the board.</p>
<p>To make this game work, you’ll eventually get around to checking if one of the players won or if there is a tie. Plan ahead for how you track the grid clicks because you’ll need to know the “value” of each square to calculate wins.</p>
