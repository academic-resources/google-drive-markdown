<p>When you click “New Game”, randomly assign the computer as Player X or Player O. Then, have the computer play automatically in response to its turn.</p>
<p>For example, if you click “New Game” and the computer becomes Player X, then it will play an “X” on the board. Then, you will play an “O”. After you click your square, the computer will automatically play its “X”. And, so on.</p>
<p>If the computer is Player O, then it will play after you play your first “X”.</p>
