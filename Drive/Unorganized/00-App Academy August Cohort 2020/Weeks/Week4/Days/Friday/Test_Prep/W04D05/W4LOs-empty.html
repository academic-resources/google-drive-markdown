<ol type="1">
<li><p>Given HTML that includes <code>&lt;div id=”catch-me-if-you-can”&gt;HI!&lt;/div&gt;</code>, write a JavaScript statement that stores a reference to the HTMLDivElement with the id “catch-me-if-you-can” in a variable named “divOfInterest”.</p></li>
<li><p>Given HTML that includes seven SPAN elements each with the class “cloudy”, write a JavaScript statement that stores a reference to a NodeList filled with references to the seven HTMLSpanElements in a variable named “cloudySpans”.</p></li>
<li><p>Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, and BODY elements, create and reference a JS file that in which the JavaScript will create and attach to the BODY element an H1 element with the id “sleeping-giant” with the content “Jell-O, Burled!”.</p></li>
<li><p>Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with the SCRIPT’s SRC attribute referencing an empty JS file, write a script in the JS file to create a DIV element with the id “lickable-frog” and add it as the last child to the BODY element.</p></li>
<li><p>Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with no SRC attribute on the SCRIPT element, write a script in the SCRIPT block to create a UL element with no id, create an LI element with the id “dreamy-eyes”, add the LI as a child to the UL element, and add the UL element as the first child of the BODY element.</p></li>
<li><p>Write JavaScript to add the CSS class “i-got-loaded” to the BODY element when the window fires the DOMContentLoaded event.</p></li>
<li><p>Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id “your-best-friend” that has six non-empty LIs as its children, write JavaScript to write the content of each LI to the console.</p></li>
<li><p>Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id “your-worst-enemy” that has no children, write JavaScript to construct a string that contains six LI tags each containing a random number and set the inner HTML property of ul#your-worst-enemy to that string.</p></li>
<li><p>Write JavaScript to update the title of the document to the current time at a reasonable interval such that it looks like a real clock.</p></li>
