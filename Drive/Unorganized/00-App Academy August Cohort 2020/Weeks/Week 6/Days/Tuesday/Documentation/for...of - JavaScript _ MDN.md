The **`for...of` statement** creates a loop iterating over [iterable
objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol),
including: built-in
[`String`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String),
[`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array),
array-like objects (e.g.,
[`arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
or¬†[`NodeList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList)),
[`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray),
[`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map),
[`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set),
and user-defined iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with
statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the
object.

## Syntax {#Syntax}

```{.syntaxbox .notranslate}
for (variable of iterable) {
  statement
}
```

`variable`
: On each iteration a value of a different property is assigned to
`variable`. `variable` may be declared with `const`, `let`, or
`var`.
`iterable`
: Object whose iterable properties are iterated.

## Examples {#Examples}

### Iterating over an [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) {#Iterating_over_an_Array}

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const iterable = [10, 20, 30];

for (const value of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
// 10
// 20
// 30
```

You can use
[`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
instead of
[`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
too, if you reassign the variable inside the block.

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const iterable = [10, 20, 30];

for (let value of iterable) {
  value += 1;
  console.log(value);
}
// 11
// 21
// 31
```

### Iterating over a [`String`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) {#Iterating_over_a_String}

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const iterable = 'boo';

for (const value of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
// "b"
// "o"
// "o"
```

### Iterating over a [`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) {#Iterating_over_a_TypedArray}

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const iterable = new Uint8Array([0x00, 0xff]);

for (const value of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
// 0
// 255
```

### Iterating over a [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) {#Iterating_over_a_Map}

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const iterable = new Map([['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3]]);

for (const entry of iterable) {
  console.log(entry);
}
// ['a', 1]
// ['b', 2]
// ['c', 3]

for (const [key, value] of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

### Iterating over a [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) {#Iterating_over_a_Set}

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const iterable = new Set([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]);

for (const value of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

### Iterating over the arguments object {#Iterating_over_the_arguments_object}

You can iterate over the
[`arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
object to examine all of the parameters passed into a JavaScript
function:

```{.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
(function() {
  for (const argument of arguments) {
    console.log(argument);
  }
})(1, 2, 3);

// 1
// 2
// 3
```

### Iterating over a DOM collection {#Iterating_over_a_DOM_collection}

Iterating over DOM collections like
[`NodeList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList "NodeList objects are collections of nodes, usually returned by properties such as Node.childNodes and methods such as document.querySelectorAll()."):
the following example adds a `read` class to paragraphs that are direct
descendants of an article:

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
// Note: This will only work in platforms that have
// implemented NodeList.prototype[Symbol.iterator]
const articleParagraphs = document.querySelectorAll('article > p');

for (const paragraph of articleParagraphs) {
  paragraph.classList.add('read');
}
```

### Closing iterators {#Closing_iterators}

In `for...of` loops, abrupt iteration termination can be caused by
`break`, `throw` or `return`. In these cases, the iterator is closed.

```{.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
function* foo(){
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
};

for (const o of foo()) {
  console.log(o);
  break; // closes iterator, execution continues outside of the loop
}
console.log('done');
```

### Iterating over generators {#Iterating_over_generators}

You can also iterate over
[generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*),
i.e. functions generating an iterable object:

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
function* fibonacci() { // a generator function
  let [prev, curr] = [0, 1];
  while (true) {
    [prev, curr] = [curr, prev + curr];
    yield curr;
  }
}

for (const n of fibonacci()) {
  console.log(n);
  // truncate the sequence at 1000
  if (n >= 1000) {
    break;
  }
}
```

#### Do not reuse generators {#Do_not_reuse_generators}

Generators should not be re-used, even if the `for...of` loop is
terminated early, for example via the
[`break`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break)
keyword. Upon exiting a loop, the generator is closed and trying to
iterate over it again does not yield any further results.

```{.brush: .js .example-bad .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const gen = (function *(){
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
})();
for (const o of gen) {
  console.log(o);
  break;  // Closes iterator
}

// The generator should not be re-used, the following does not make sense!
for (const o of gen) {
  console.log(o); // Never called.
}
```

### Iterating over other iterable objects {#Iterating_over_other_iterable_objects}

You can also iterate over an object that explicitly implements
the¬†[iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#iterable)
protocol:

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const iterable = {
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    return {
      i: 0,
      next() {
        if (this.i < 3) {
          return { value: this.i++, done: false };
        }
        return { value: undefined, done: true };
      }
    };
  }
};

for (const value of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
// 0
// 1
// 2
```

### Difference between `for...of` and `for...in` {#Difference_between_for...of_and_for...in}

Both `for...in` and `for...of` statements iterate over something. The
main difference between them is in what they iterate over.

The
[`for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)
statement iterates over the [enumerable
properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties)
of an object, in an arbitrary order.

The `for...of` statement iterates over values that the [iterable
object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#Iterables)
defines to be iterated over.

The following example shows the difference between a `for...of` loop and
a `for...in` loop when used with an
[`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

```{.brush:js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
Object.prototype.objCustom = function() {};
Array.prototype.arrCustom = function() {};

const iterable = [3, 5, 7];
iterable.foo = 'hello';

for (const i in iterable) {
  console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, "foo", "arrCustom", "objCustom"
}

for (const i in iterable) {
  if (iterable.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, "foo"
  }
}

for (const i of iterable) {
  console.log(i); // logs 3, 5, 7
}
```

Let us look into the above code step by step.

```{.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
Object.prototype.objCustom = function() {};
Array.prototype.arrCustom = function() {};

const iterable = [3, 5, 7];
iterable.foo = 'hello';
```

Every object will inherit the¬†`objCustom` property and every object that
is an
[`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
will inherit the¬†`arrCustom` property since these properties have been
added to
[`Object.prototype`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype)
and `Array.prototype`, respectively. The object `iterable` inherits the
properties `objCustom` and `arrCustom` because of [inheritance and the
prototype
chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

```{.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
for (const i in iterable) {
  console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, "foo", "arrCustom", "objCustom"
}
```

This loop logs only [enumerable
properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties)
of the `iterable` object, in arbitrary order. It doesn't log array
**elements** `3`, `5`, `7` or `hello` because those are **not**
enumerable properties, in fact they are not properties at all, they are
**values**. It logs array **indexes** as well as `arrCustom` and
`objCustom`, which are. If you're not sure why these properties are
iterated over, there's a more thorough explanation of how
[`array iteration and for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in#Array_iteration_and_for...in)
work.

```{.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
for (const i in iterable) {
  if (iterable.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, "foo"
  }
}
```

This loop is similar to the first one, but it uses
[`hasOwnProperty()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty)
to check if the found enumerable property is the object's own, i.e. not
inherited. If it is, the property is logged. Properties `0`, `1`, `2`
and `foo` are logged because they are own properties (**not
inherited**). Properties `arrCustom` and `objCustom` are not logged
because they **are inherited**.

```{.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
for (const i of iterable) {
  console.log(i); // logs 3, 5, 7
}
```

This loop iterates and logs **values** that `iterable`, as an [iterable
object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators#Iterables),
defines to be iterated over.¬†The object's **elements** `3`, `5`, `7` are
shown, but none¬†of the object's **properties**.
