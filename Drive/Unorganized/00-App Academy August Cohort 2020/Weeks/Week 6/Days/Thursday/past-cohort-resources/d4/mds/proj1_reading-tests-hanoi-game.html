<h1 id="towers-of-hanoi-reading-and-passing-tests">Towers of Hanoi: Reading and Passing Tests</h1>
<p>Time to put your newfound mocha knowledge to the test! In this project you’ll be following what is now a familiar pattern - running automated tests and writing code to pass those tests. The difference this time round is that we will only provide very minimal written information for the code you’ll be writing. This project will revolve around reading the provided tests and then writing code to pass those tests.</p>
<p>We’ve provided you with a skeleton for a JavaScript version of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Towers of Hanoi</a> game. If you’ve never played the game take a moment to watch a quick video of how it is played or check out <a href="https://www.mathplayground.com/logic_tower_of_hanoi.html">this</a> playable version (beware the game has sound). For the version we are building, a game of Towers of Hanoi will be played using three towers and using three pieces which we’ll refer to as <code>disks</code> from now on.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded the skeleton make sure you <code>npm install</code> to install the dependencies the tests will rely on. We’ll be using <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/"><code>Chai</code></a> in combination with <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/plugins/chai-spies/"><code>chai-spies</code></a> as our assertion libraries for this project so we recommend keeping both documentation pages open. The tests you’ll be working on will be in the <code>test/game-spec.js</code> file and you’ll be doing all your work within the <code>hanoi/hanoi-game.js</code> file. You will not need to specify any new methods upon the <code>HanoiGame</code> class - just fill in empty methods provided.</p>
<p>Carefully read each spec and concentrate on passing them one at a time in the order they are written. As always, to run the specs use the <code>mocha</code> command in the top level directory.</p>
<p>You got this! Once you’ve passed all the specs feel free to play a game of Hanoi in your terminal by running <code>node hanoi/play-script.js</code> before moving on to the next project.</p>
<p>To get the skeleton just <code>git clone</code> the repository at <a href="https://github.com/appacademy-starters/project-hanoi-game-skeleton">https://github.com/appacademy-starters/project-hanoi-game-skeleton</a></p>
