    <ul>
      <li>
        Mocha’s “interface” system allows developers to choose their style of
        DSL. Mocha has BDD, TDD, Exports, QUnit and Require-style interfaces.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>#BDD</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The BDD interface provides describe(), context(), it(), specify(),
          before(), after(), beforeEach(), and afterEach().
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            context() is just an alias for describe(), and behaves the same way;
            it provides a way to keep tests easier to read and organized.
            Similarly, specify() is an alias for it().
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>describe function</strong> is an organizational function
        that accepts <em><code>a descriptive string and a callback</code></em
        >.

      <li>
        We’ll use the describe function to describe what we will be testing -

The outer describe function&#39;s message of reverseString() is on the upper level
and the inner it function&#39;s message of should reverse the input string is nested within.
Strictly speaking we aren&#39;t required to nest our it functions within describe functions but it is best practice to do so.</code></pre>
