<h1 id="http">HTTP</h1>
<p><strong>The objective of this lesson</strong> is for you to get comfortable with the main concepts of HTTP. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web. It’s essential knowledge for developers who work with the web. At the end of it, you’ll be able to identify common HTTP verbs and status codes, as well as demonstrating how HTTP is used by setting up a simple server.</p>
<p>When you finish, you should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>match the header fields of HTTP with a bank of definitions.</li>
<li>matching HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE) to their common uses.</li>
<li>match common HTTP status codes (200, 302, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 500) to their meanings.</li>
<li>send a simple HTTP request to <code>google.com</code></li>
<li>write a very simple HTTP server using ‘http’ in node with paths that will result in the common HTTP status codes.</li>
</ul>
