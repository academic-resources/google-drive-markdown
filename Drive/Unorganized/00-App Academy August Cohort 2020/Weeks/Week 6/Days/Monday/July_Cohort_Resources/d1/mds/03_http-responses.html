<h1 id="http-responses">HTTP Responses</h1>
<p>A web server delivers content via <em>responses</em>, the second part of the HTTP’s request/response cycle. Let’s dive into how a response is structured and what your client can expect from the server.</p>
<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP response structure,</li>
<li>differentiating errors &amp; successful transfers,</li>
<li>and how to use a server to generate your own responses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hypertext-delivered">Hypertext delivered</h2>
<p>An HTTP response contains either the content we requested or an explanation of why that content couldn’t be delivered. It’s just like ordering at a restaurant: you place your order and receive either a plate of delicious food or an apology from the chef. In a good restaurant, the apology will include some extra help: “I’m sorry, we’re out of broccoli. Can we get you something else? How can we make this right?”.</p>
<p>When designing your own HTTP responses, remember that restaurant example. It’s important to note that there’s a problem, but it’s equally important to provide reliable, helpful details. We’ll look at some examples of this when we build our own HTTP server in a later lesson.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-a-response">Structure of a Response</h2>
<p>Responses are formatted similarly to requests: we’ll have a <em>status-line</em> (instead of a request-line), headers that provide helpful metadata about the response, and the response body: a representation of the requested resource.</p>
<p>Here’s what the HTTP response looks like when visiting <code>appacademy.io</code>:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK

&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Oof! That’s a lot of unfamiliar stuff. Let’s walk through the important bits together.</p>
<h3 id="status">Status</h3>
<p>Like the request, an HTTP response’s first line gives you a high-level overview of the server’s intention. For the response, we refer to this as the <em>status-line</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s the status line from our <code>appacademy.io</code> response:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</code></pre>
<p>We open with the HTTP version the server is responding with. <code>1.1</code> is still the most commonly used, though you may occasionally see <code>2</code> or even <code>1.0</code>. We follow this with a <code>Status-Code</code> and <code>Reason-Phrase</code>. These give us a quick way of understanding if our request was successful or not.</p>
<p><em>HTTP status codes</em> are a numeric way of representing a server’s response. Each code is a three-digit number accompanied by a short description. They’re grouped by the first digit (so, for example, all “Informational” codes begin with a <code>1</code>: <code>100</code> - <code>199</code>).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the most common codes in each group.</p>
<h4 id="status-codes-100---199-informational">Status codes 100 - 199: Informational</h4>
<p>Informational codes let the client know that a request was received, and provide extra info from the server. There are very few informational codes defined by the HTTP specification and you’re unlikely to see them, but it’s good to know that they exist!</p>
<h4 id="status-codes-200---299-successful">Status codes 200 - 299: Successful</h4>
<p>Successful response codes indicate that the request has succeeded and the server is handling it. Here are a couple common examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>200 OK</strong>: Request received and fulfilled. These usually come with a <code>body</code> that contains the resource you requested.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>201 Created</strong>: Your request was received and a new record was created as a result. You’ll often see this response to <code>POST</code> requests.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="status-codes-300---399-redirection">Status codes 300 - 399: Redirection</h4>
<p>These responses let the client know that there has been a change. There are a few different ways for a server to note a redirect, but the two most common are also the most important:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong>: The resource you requested is in a totally new location. This might be used if a webpage has changed domains, or if resources were reorganized on the server. Most clients will automatically process this redirect and send you to the new location, so you may not notice this response at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>302 Found</strong>: Similarly, to <em>301 Moved Permanently</em>, this indicates that a resource has moved. However, this code is used to indicate a temporary move. It’s not often that you see temporary moves online, but this code may be used to indicate a permanent move where the old domain should still be valid too. Clients will usually follow this redirect automatically as well, but you shouldn’t necessarily update your links until the server returns a <code>301</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>301 Moved Permanently</em> and <em>302 Found</em> often get confused. When might we want to use a <em>302 Found</em>`_? The most common use case today is for the transition from HTTP to HTTPS. <em>HTTPS</em> is secure HTTP messaging, where requests &amp; responses are <em>encrypted</em> so they can’t be read by prying eyes while en route to their destinations.</p>
<p>This is a much safer way of communicating online, so most websites require access via <code>https://</code> before the domain. However, we don’t want to ignore folks still trying to access our content from the older <code>http://</code> approach!</p>
<p>In this case, we’ll return a <em>302 Found</em> response to the client, letting them know that it’s okay to keep navigating to <code>http://our-website.com</code>, but we’re going to redirect them to <code>https://our-website.com</code> for their protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="status-codes-400---499-client-error">Status codes 400 - 499: Client Error</h4>
<p>The status codes from 400 to 499, inclusive, indicate that there is a problem with the client’s request. Maybe there was a typo, or maybe the resource we requested is no longer available. You’ll see lots of these as you’re learning to format HTTP requests. Here are the most common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>400 Bad Request</strong>: Whoops! The server received your request, but couldn’t understand it. You might see a <em>400 Bad Request</em> in response to a typo or accidentally truncated request. We often refer to these as <em>malformed</em> requests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong>: The resource you requested may exist, but you’re not allowed to see it without authentication. These type of responses might mean one of two things: either you didn’t log in yet, or you tried to log in but your credentials aren’t being accepted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>403 Forbidden</strong>: The resource you requested may exist, but you’re not allowed to see it <em>at all</em>. This response code means this resource isn’t accessible to you, even if you’re logged in. You just don’t have the correct permission to see it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>404 Not Found</strong>: The resource you requested doesn’t exist. You may see this response if you have a typo in your request (for example: going to <code>appaccccademy.io</code>), or if you’re looking for something that has been removed.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>403 Forbidden</em> requests let the client know that a valid resource was requested. This can be a security risk! For example: if I guess that you have <em>passwords.html</em> on your website because you just <em>want</em> to be hacked, a <em>403 Forbidden</em> response tells me I’m correct. For this reason, some sites will return a <em>404 Not Found</em> for resources that exist but aren’t accessible.</p>
<p>A well-known example is GitHub. If you try to open a repository you don’t have permission to access, GitHub will return a <em>404 Not Found</em> even if your URL is correct! This protects you from random users guessing the names of your projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="status-codes-500---599-server-error">Status codes 500 - 599: Server Error</h4>
<p>This range of response codes are the Web’s way of saying “It’s not you, it’s me.” These indicate that your request was formatted correctly, but that the server couldn’t do what you asked due to an internal problem.</p>
<p>There are two common codes in this range you’ll see while getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>: Your request was received, and the server tried to process it, but something went awry! As you’re learning to write your own servers, you’ll often see a <em>500 Internal Server Error</em> as your code fails unexpectedly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>504 Gateway Timeout</strong>: Your request was received but the server didn’t respond in a reasonable amount of time. Timeout errors can be tricky: your first instinct may be that your own connection is bad, but this code means the problem is likely on the server’s side. You’ll often see these when a server is no longer reachable (maybe due to an unexpected outage or power failure).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="headers">Headers</h3>
<p>Headers on HTTP responses work identically to those on requests. They establish metadata that the receiving client might need to process the response. Here are a few common response headers you’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Location</strong>: Used by the client for redirection responses. This contains the URL the client should redirect to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content-Type</strong>: Lets the client know what format the body is in. Your client will display different types of response content in different ways, to setting the <em>Content-Type</em> is important! Notice that this header can be present on responses <strong>and</strong> requests. It’s a generic header for any HTTP interaction involving content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expires</strong>: When the response should be considered <em>stale</em>, or no longer valid. The <em>Expires</em> header lets your client <em>cache</em> responses (that is: save them locally to prevent having to repeatedly re-download them). The client may ignore requests to that same resource until after the date set in the <em>Expires</em> header.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content-Disposition</strong>: This header lets the client know how to display the response, and is specifically devoted to whether the response should be visible to the client or delivered as a download. Think about your own experience online: sometimes you click a button and get an immediate download, while in other cases you click a button and get to “preview” the content before you download it. This is controlled by the <em>Content-Disposition</em> header.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Set-Cookie</strong>: This header sends data back to the client to set on the <em>cookie</em>, a set of key/value pairs associated with the server’s domain. Remember how HTTP is <em>stateless</em>? Cookies are one way to get around that! <em>Set-Cookie</em> may send back information like a unique ID for the user you’ve logged in as or details about other resources you’ve requested on this domain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember - this isn’t an exhaustive list of headers! Sites and intermediate gateways/proxies can define their own custom headers, so you’ll see many more than these. If you’re unsure what a header does, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">MDN HTTP Header documentation</a> is a great place to start searching.</p>
<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
<p>Assuming a successful request, the <em>body</em> of the response contains the resource you’ve requested. For a website, this means the HTML of the page you’re accessing.</p>
<p>The format of the body is dictated by the <em>Content-Type</em> header. This is an important detail! If you accidentally configure your server to send “Content-Type: application/json” along with a body containing HTML, your HTML won’t be rendered properly and your users will see plain text instead of beautifully-rendered elements. In the same way, API responses should be clearly marked so that other applications know how to manage them.</p>
<p>We can see in our <code>appacademy.io</code> response above that the body begins with <code>!&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> and ends with <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. If you inspect the source of the page in your browser, you’ll see that this is exactly what’s being rendered. Headers may change <strong>how</strong> the browser handles the body, but they won’t <strong>modify</strong> the body’s content.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-custom-server-to-generate-responses">Using a custom server to generate responses</h2>
<p>At its most basic, a web server is just a tool to generate HTTP responses. Therefore, the best way to practice is to build your own webserver!</p>
<p>We’ll walk through building our own server from scratch using Node.js in an upcoming video lesson.</p>
<h2 id="what-weve-learned">What we’ve learned</h2>
<p>Like HTTP requests, HTTP responses involve lots of new lingo and details. Hang in there - we’ll start doing practical work with this new vocabulary in the projects &amp; video demos coming up.</p>
<p>After this reading, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the parts of an HTTP response,</li>
<li>be able to identify common status codes &amp; their meanings,</li>
<li>recognize common response headers,</li>
<li>and be prepared to build your own server!</li>
</ul>
