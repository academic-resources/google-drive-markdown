<p><strong>Discrete Fourier Transform</strong> Even though Discrete Fourier Transform or DFT is probably not the thing you work with daily it might still be a very interesting algorithm to play with. Not because it is quite complex but because of its interesting meaning.</p>
<p>This algorithm allows you to split the input signal that is spread in time into the number of frequencies of certain length, amplitudes and phases so that all those frequencies together will form the original signal. So it actually converts the domain of time into domain of frequencies and backwards. <img src="2020-08-12-05-43-56.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Smoothie Example</strong> Imagine you have smoothie. DFT then will allow you to split smoothie into its ingredients! Imagine that you provide the bottle of smoothie as an input for DFT function and it splits it out to three smaller bottles of pure carrot, apple and orange juices! This is what DFT does - it splits the whole input into its ingredients.</p>
