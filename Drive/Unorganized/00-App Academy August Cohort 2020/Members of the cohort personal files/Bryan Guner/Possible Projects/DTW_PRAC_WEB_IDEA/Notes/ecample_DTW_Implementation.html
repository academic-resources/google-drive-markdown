<p><img src="2020-08-12-04-37-16.png" /> <strong>in the table linked above:</strong> ● For each cell, the cost of arriving at the cell from the bottom, left, and bottom-left is calculated. ● On the point (2,2) of Figure 7 below, it costs 2 units to arrive from the bottom cell because the bottom cell’s lowest value plus the current cell value is 2. ● It costs 1 to arrive from the left because 2 + 0 = 2. It costs 1 to arrive from the bottom left because 1 + (½)*0 = 1. ● After calculating the costs for each cell, the least cost path can be determined. To find the least cost path, one must make three assumptions. ● The first is that the path always begins at point (1,1) and end at the upper right most cell. ● Secondly, it is assumed that the least cost path should lie along the diagonal of the matrix, so diagonal movement should be favored over lateral movement. ● Can adress the aformentioned desire for diagonal transversal by implementating a reduction in the cost of diagonal movement by 50%. ● Finally, the third assumption is that because time moves forward, one should never move backwards to find the least cost path. ● Calculating the least cost path involves starting at the upper right most cell and working backwards to the starting cell. ● The path chosen should be the cell with the lowest cost of arrival. ● //————————————– <strong>Cost of arrivial per cell:</strong> <img src="2020-08-12-04-45-10.png" /> //————————————–</p>
