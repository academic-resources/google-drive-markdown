# Testing

**The objective of this lesson** is to ensure that you understand the
fundamentals of testing and are capable of reading and solving specs. **This
lesson is relevant** to you because good testing is one of the foundations of
being a good developer.

When you finish, you should be able to:

* Explain the "red-green-refactor" loop of test-driven development.
* Identify the definitions of SyntaxError, ReferenceError, and TypeError
* Create, modify, and get to pass a suite of Mocha tests
* Use Chai to structure your tests using behavior-driven development principles.
* Use the pre- and post-test hooks provided by Mocha
