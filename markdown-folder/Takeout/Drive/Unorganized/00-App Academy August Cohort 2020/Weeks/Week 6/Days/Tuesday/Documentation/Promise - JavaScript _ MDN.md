The **`Promise`** object represents the eventual completion (or failure)
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

To learn about the way promises work and how you can use them, we advise
you to read [Using
promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
first.

Description {#Description}
-----------

A `Promise` is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the
promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an
asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This
lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods:
instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous
method returns a *promise* to supply the value at some point in the
future.

A `Promise` is in one of these states:

-   *pending*: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
-   *fulfilled*: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
-   *rejected*: meaning that the operation failed.

A pending promise can either be *fulfilled* with a value or *rejected*
with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the
associated handlers queued up by a promise's `then` method are called.
If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a
corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there
is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and
its handlers being attached.

As the `Promise.prototype.then()` and `Promise.prototype.catch()`
methods return promises, they can be chained.

![](./Promise%20-%20JavaScript%20_%20MDN_files/promises.png)

**Not to be confused with:** Several other languages have mechanisms for
lazy evaluation and deferring a computation, which they also call
"promises", e.g. Scheme. Promises in JavaScript represent processes that
are already happening, which can be chained with callback functions. If
you are looking to lazily evaluate an expression, consider the [arrow
function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
with no arguments: `f = () => expression` to create the lazily-evaluated
expression, and `f()` to evaluate.

**Note**: A promise is said to be *settled* if it is either fulfilled or
rejected, but not pending. You will also hear the term *resolved* used
with promises ‚Äî this means that the promise is settled or ‚Äúlocked-in‚Äù to
match the state of another promise. [States and
fates](https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md)
contain more details about promise terminology.

### Chained Promises {#Chained_Promises}

The methods `promise.then()`, `promise.catch()`, and `promise.finally()`
are used to associate further action with a promise that becomes
settled. These methods also return a newly generated promise object,
which can optionally be used for chaining; for example, like this:

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const myPromise = 
  (new Promise(myExecutorFunc))
  .then(handleFulfilledA,handleRejectedA)
  .then(handleFulfilledB,handleRejectedB)
  .then(handleFulfilledC,handleRejectedC);

// or, perhaps better ...

const myPromise =
  (new Promise(myExecutorFunc))
  .then(handleFulfilledA)
  .then(handleFulfilledB)
  .then(handleFulfilledC)
  .catch(handleRejectedAny);
```

Handling a rejected promise too early has consequences further down the
promise chain. Sometimes there is no choice because an error must be
handled immediately. (See `throw -999` in the example, below, for a
technique to handle the consequences.) On the other hand, in the absence
of an immediate need, it is simpler to leave out error handling until a
final .catch() statement.

The signatures of these two functions are simple, they accept a single
parameter of any type. These functions are written by you, the
programmer. The termination condition of these functions determines the
"settled" state of the next promise in the chain. Any termination other
than a `throw` creates a "resolved" state while terminating with a
`throw` creates a "rejected" state.

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
handleFulfilled(value)       { /*...*/; return nextValue;  }
handleRejection(reason)  { /*...*/; throw  nextReason; }
handleRejection(reason)  { /*...*/; return nextValue;  }
```

The returned `nextValue` can be another promise object, in which case
the promise gets dynamically inserted into the chain.

When a `.then()` lacks the appropriate function that returns a Promise
object, processing simply continues to the next link of the chain.
Therefore, a chain can safely omit every `handleRejection` until the
final `.catch()`. Similarly, `.catch()` is really just a `.then()`
without a slot for `handleFulfilled`.

The promises of a chain are nested like Russian dolls, but get popped
like the top of a stack. The first promise in the chain is most deeply
nested and is the first to pop.

``` {.notranslate .line-numbers .language-html}
(promise D, (promise C, (promise B, (promise A) ) ) )
```

When a `nextValue` is a promise, the effect is a dynamic replacement.
The `return` causes a promise to be popped, but the `nextValue` promise
is pushed into its place. For the nesting shown above, suppose the
`.then()` associated with "promise B" returns a `nextValue` of "promise
X". The resulting nesting would look like this:

``` {.notranslate .line-numbers .language-html}
(promise D, (promise C, (promise X) ) )
```

A promise can participate in more than one nesting. For the following
code, the transition of `promiseA` into a "settled" state will cause
both instances of `.then()` to be invoked.

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const promiseA = new Promise(myExecutorFunc);
const promiseB = promiseA.then(handleFulfilled1, handleRejected1);
const promiseC = promiseA.then(handleFulfilled2, handleRejected2); 
```

An action can be assigned to an already "settled" promise. In that case,
the action (if appropriate) will be performed at the first asynchronous
opportunity. Note that promises are guaranteed to be asynchronous.
Therefore, an action for an already "settled" promise will occur only
after the stack has cleared and a clock-tick has passed. The effect is
much like that of `setTimeout(action,10)`.

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
const promiseA = new Promise( (resolutionFunc,rejectionFunc) => {
    resolutionFunc(777);
});
// At this point, "promiseA" is already settled.
promiseA.then( (val) => console.log("asynchronous logging has val:",val) );
console.log("immediate logging");

// produces output in this order:
// immediate logging
// asynchronous logging has val: 777
```

Constructor {#Constructor}
-----------

[`Promise()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise)
:   Creates a new `Promise` object. The constructor is primarily used to
    wrap functions that do not already support promises.

Static methods {#Static_methods}
--------------

[`Promise.all(iterable)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)
:   Wait for all promises to be resolved, or for any to be rejected.
:   If the returned promise resolves, it is resolved with an aggregating
    array of the values from the resolved promises, in the same order as
    defined in the iterable of multiple promises.
:   If it rejects, it is rejected with the reason from the first promise
    in the iterable that was rejected.
[`Promise.allSettled(iterable)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)
:   Wait until all promises have settled (each may resolve or reject).
:   Returns a Promise that resolves after all of the given promises have
    either resolved or rejected, with an array of objects that each
    describe the outcome of each promise.
[`Promise.any(iterable)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any)
:   Takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the
    promises in the iterable fulfills, returns a single promise that
    resolves with the value from that promise.
[`Promise.race(iterable)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)
:   Wait until any of the promises is resolved or rejected.
:   If the returned promise resolves, it is resolved with the value of
    the first promise in the iterable that resolved.
:   If it rejects, it is rejected with the reason from the first promise
    that was rejected.
[`Promise.reject(reason)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject)
:   Returns a new `Promise` object that is rejected with the given
    reason.
[`Promise.resolve(value)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve)
:   Returns a new `Promise` object that is resolved with the given
    value. If the value is a thenable (i.e. has a `then` method), the
    returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual
    state; otherwise, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the
    value.
:   Generally, if you don't know if a value is a promise or not,
    [`Promise.resolve(value)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve)
    it instead and work with the return value as a promise.

Instance methods {#Instance_methods}
----------------

[`Promise.prototype.catch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch)
:   Appends a rejection handler callback to the promise, and returns a
    new promise resolving to the return value of the callback if it is
    called, or to its original fulfillment value if the promise is
    instead fulfilled.
[`Promise.prototype.then()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)
:   Appends fulfillment and rejection handlers to the promise, and
    returns a new promise resolving to the return value of the called
    handler, or to its original settled value if the promise was not
    handled (i.e. if the relevant handler `onFulfilled` or `onRejected`
    is not a function).
[`Promise.prototype.finally()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/finally)
:   Appends a handler to the promise, and returns a new promise that is
    resolved when the original promise is resolved. The handler is
    called when the promise is settled, whether fulfilled or rejected.

Examples {#Examples}
--------

### Basic Example {#Basic_Example}

``` {.brush: .js; .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
let myFirstPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // We call resolve(...) when what we were doing asynchronously was successful, and reject(...) when it failed.
  // In this example, we use setTimeout(...) to simulate async code. 
  // In reality, you will probably be using something like XHR or an HTML5 API.
  setTimeout( function() {
    resolve("Success!")  // Yay! Everything went well!
  }, 250) 
}) 

myFirstPromise.then((successMessage) => {
  // successMessage is whatever we passed in the resolve(...) function above.
  // It doesn't have to be a string, but if it is only a succeed message, it probably will be.
  console.log("Yay! " + successMessage) 
});
```

### Example with diverse situations {#Example_with_diverse_situations}

This example shows diverse techniques for using Promise capabilities and
diverse situations that can occur. To understand this, start by
scrolling to the bottom of the code block, and examine the promise
chain. Upon provision of an initial promise, a chain of promises can
follow. The chain is composed of `.then()` calls, and typically (but not
necessarily) has a single `.catch()` at the end, optionally followed by
`.finally()`. In this example, the promise chain is initiated by a
custom-written `new Promise()` construct; but in actual practice,
promise chains more typically start with an API function (written by
someone else) that returns a promise.

The example function `tetheredGetNumber()` shows that a promise
generator will utilize `reject()` while setting up an asynchronous call,
or within the call-back, or both. The function `promiseGetWord()`
illustrates how an API function might generate and return a promise in a
self-contained manner.

Note that the function `troubleWithGetNumber()` ends with a `throw()`.
That is forced because an ES6 promise chain goes through all the
`.then()` promises, even after an error, and without the "throw()", the
error would seem "fixed". This is a hassle, and for this reason, it is
common to omit `rejectionFunc` throughout the chain of `.then()`
promises, and just have a single `rejectionFunc` in the final `catch()`.
The alternative is to throw a special value (in this case "-999", but a
custom Error type would be more appropriate).

This code can be run under NodeJS. Comprehension is enhanced by seeing
the errors actually occur. To force more errors, change the `threshold`
values.

``` {.brush: .js .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
"use strict";

// To experiment with error handling, "threshold" values cause errors randomly
const THRESHOLD_A = 8; // can use zero 0 to guarantee error

function tetheredGetNumber(resolve, reject) {
  try {
    setTimeout( 
      function() {
        const randomInt = Date.now();
        const value = randomInt % 10;
        try { 
          if(value >= THRESHOLD_A) {
            throw new Error(`Too large: ${value}`);
          } 
        } catch(msg) {
            reject(`Error in callback ${msg}`); 
        }
      resolve(value);
      return;
    }, 500);
    // To experiment with error at set-up, uncomment the following 'throw'.
    // throw new Error("Bad setup");
  } catch(err) {
    reject(`Error during setup: ${err}`);
  }
  return;
}

function determineParity(value) {
  const isOdd = value % 2 ? true : false ;
  const parityInfo = { theNumber: value, isOdd: isOdd };
  return parityInfo;
}

function troubleWithGetNumber(reason) {
  console.error(`Trouble getting number: ${reason}`);
  throw -999; // must "throw" something, to maintain error state down the chain
}

function promiseGetWord(parityInfo) {
  // The "tetheredGetWord()" function gets "parityInfo" as closure variable.
  var tetheredGetWord = function(resolve,reject) {
    const theNumber = parityInfo.theNumber;
    const threshold_B = THRESHOLD_A - 1;
    if(theNumber >= threshold_B) {
      reject(`Still too large: ${theNumber}`);
    } else {
      parityInfo.wordEvenOdd = parityInfo.isOdd ? 'odd' : 'even';
      resolve(parityInfo);
    }
    return;
  }
  return new Promise(tetheredGetWord);
}

(new Promise(tetheredGetNumber))
  .then(determineParity,troubleWithGetNumber)
  .then(promiseGetWord)
  .then((info) => { 
    console.log("Got: ",info.theNumber," , ", info.wordEvenOdd); 
    return info; 
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    if(reason === -999) {
      console.error("Had previously handled error");
    }
    else {
      console.error(`Trouble with promiseGetWord(): ${reason}`);
    }
   })
  .finally((info) => console.log("All done"));
```

### Advanced Example {#Advanced_Example}

``` {.brush: .html; .notranslate .line-numbers .language-html}
<button id="btn">Make a promise!</button>
<div id="log"></div>
```

This small example shows the mechanism of a `Promise`. The
`testPromise()` method is called each time the
[`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button "The HTML <button> element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality.")
is clicked. It creates a promise that will be fulfilled, using
[`window.setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout),
to the promise count (number starting from 1) every 1-3 seconds, at
random. The `Promise()` constructor is used to create the promise.

The fulfillment of the promise is simply logged, via a fulfill callback
set using
[`p1.then()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then).
A few logs show how the synchronous part of the method is decoupled from
the asynchronous completion of the promise.

``` {.brush: .js; .notranslate}
"use strict";
var promiseCount = 0;

function testPromise() {
  let thisPromiseCount = ++promiseCount;
  let log = document.getElementById('log');
  // begin
  log.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', thisPromiseCount + ') Started (Sync code started)');
  // We make a new promise: we promise a numeric count of this promise, starting from 1 (after waiting 3s)
  let p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // The executor function is called with the ability to resolve or reject the promise
    log.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', thisPromiseCount + ') Promise started (Async code started)');
    // This is only an example to create asynchronism
    window.setTimeout(function() {
        // We fulfill the promise !
        resolve(thisPromiseCount);
    }, Math.random() * 2000 + 1000);
  });

  // We define what to do when the promise is resolved with the then() call,
  // and what to do when the promise is rejected with the catch() call
  p1.then(function(val) {
    // Log the fulfillment value
    log.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', val + ') Promise fulfilled (Async code terminated)');
  }).catch((reason) => {
    // Log the rejection reason
    console.log(`Handle rejected promise (${reason}) here.`);
  });
  // end
  log.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', thisPromiseCount + ') Promise made (Sync code terminated)');
}
```

``` {.brush: .js; .notranslate .line-numbers .language-js}
if ("Promise" in window) {
  let btn = document.getElementById("btn");
  btn.addEventListener("click",testPromise);
} else {
  log = document.getElementById('log');
  log.innerHTML = "Live example not available as your browser doesn't support the <code>Promise<code> interface.";
}
```

This example is started by clicking the button. (You need a browser that
supports `Promise`. )

By clicking the button several times in a short amount of time, you'll
even see the different promises being fulfilled one after another.

### Loading an image with XHR {#Loading_an_image_with_XHR}

Another simple example using `Promise` and
[`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
to load an image is available at the MDN GitHub
[js-examples](https://github.com/mdn/js-examples/tree/master/promises-test)
repository. You can also [see it in
action](https://mdn.github.io/js-examples/promises-test/). Each step is
commented on and allows you to follow the Promise and XHR architecture
closely.

3.  [**Methods**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#)
    1.  [`Promise.all()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all "The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises. This returned promise will resolve when all of the input's promises have resolved, or if the input iterable contains no promises. It rejects immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting or non-promises throwing an error, and will reject with this first rejection message / error.")
    2.  [`Promise.allSettled()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled "The Promise.allSettled() method returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome of each promise.")
    3.  [`Promise.any()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any "Promise.any() takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the promises in the iterable fulfils, returns a single promise that resolves with the value from that promise. If no promises in the iterable fulfil (if all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an AggregateError, a new subclass of Error that groups together individual errors. Essentially, this method is the opposite of Promise.all().")
    4.  [`Promise.prototype.catch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch "The catch() method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only. It behaves the same as calling Promise.prototype.then(undefined, onRejected) (in fact, calling obj.catch(onRejected) internally calls obj.then(undefined, onRejected)). This means that you have to provide an onRejected function even if you want to fall back to an undefined result value - for example obj.catch(() => {}).")
    5.  [`Promise.prototype.finally()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/finally "The finally() method returns a Promise. When the promise is settled, i.e either fulfilled or rejected, the specified callback function is executed. This provides a way for code to be run whether the promise was fulfilled successfully or rejected once the Promise has been dealt with.")
    6.  [`Promise.prototype.then()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then "The then() method returns a Promise. It takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise.")
    7.  [`Promise.race()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race "The Promise.race() method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.")
    8.  [`Promise.reject()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject "The Promise.reject() method returns a Promise object that is rejected with a given reason.")
    9.  [`Promise.resolve()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve "The Promise.resolve() method returns a Promise object that is resolved with a given value. If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a thenable (i.e. has a "then" method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state;¬†otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value. This function flattens nested layers of promise-like objects (e.g. a promise that resolves to a promise that resolves to something) into a single layer.")
