Please fork and clone the repository found at https://github.com/appacademy-starters/oop-connect-four. 

**In that repository, you will find the following files:**

* index.html: The HTML file that you'll modify to structure your UI
* site.css: The CSS file that you'll modify to style your UI
* connect-four.js: The JavaScript file you'll modify to add behavior to your game
* images/: A directory that contains images for the application.
* README. md: A "read me" file that contains information about the project.
Development with a Web server


This will be the first time you use a local Web server to do your development. It's going to be nearly identical to just opening your file from the file system, but 


**you'll be using a URL with the HTTP protocol rather than the file protocol. You'll be using a simple HTTP server packaged with all Python 3 distributions. (You did install Python3 back at the end of week 1, right?)**

**After you clone your forked repository, open Visual Studio Code by typing code . in the repository directory. Then, type python3 -m http.server.**

(For those of you on Windows, if this is the first time you're running the built-in HTTP server, you may seem some other terminals popping up and then closing, then a "Windows Defender Firewall" block message. Please check both "Private networks..." and "Public networks..." boxes before clicking the "Allow access" button.)

If everything is ok with your Python installation, you will see a message similar to

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
Note that port number, open a new tab or window in your browser, and type in http://localhost:«port number» into your browser's address bar. You should see the UI!

When you need to stop the HTTP server, click back on the terminal window and type the key combination Control+C. That works on both Windows and macOS. That will stop the HTTP server.

>The rules of Connect Four



>The first player drops a checker into a slot. The checker falls to the lowest open position in the column. If all six positions are full, the player cannot play in that column.

>A player wins when they have four in a row anywhere in the board, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. ("Pretty sneaky, sis.")

>The game is a tie if the entire board fills and no one has four in a row.
